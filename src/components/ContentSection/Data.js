They are a SaaS company that works to connect people with buildings by providing insights, analytics, and data representation for a buildings HVAC system and other equipment. They are located in Washington D.C., but I am currently working remotely as a Software Engineer Intern for them and have accepted a full time offer starting in January 2021. Ive worked with a variety of tools and languages but find I most enjoy languages like Java and working on front end development. For this project, I worked on getting the front end designed and implemented for the tic-tac-toe game with React and NodeJS. We wanted to add a twist on the COVID-19 tracker that everyone was doing by adding something that would provide a moment of stress relief when looking at the state of the world during this pandemic.',

    description: 'In this project, I primarily worked on implementing an 3D interactive globe that shows the COVID-19 cases worldwide and an interactive US map that shows the COVID-19 cases nationwide. I hooked the search functionality of each of the map with the serverless function I made which help reduce retrieval time by caching temporal data in Redis Cache. Other than that, I wrote e2e tests for the applications using Jest&Puppeteer and set up CI/CD pipeline under Github Actions. About me, I have a keen interest in learning about designing software and writing blog. I hope that in the future the pandemic is cleared out and I have more chances to work on interesting projects like this.',

    description: 'I thought that Ultimate TicTacToe was not a widely known thing when I recommended adding it to our Covid Tracker. It wasnt until we were trying to come up with the rules that Payton mentioned she found it on Wikipedia and also that some acquaintances had mentioned it in a message thread as well. But I digress... I worked on the backend logic for the Ultimate TicTacToe game as well as played my part to help others where I could be it by boosting moral with as many references I could, playing devils advocate, garnering extra credit from Shane or letting Van use my heroku account. I, at this moment, have a position as a Software Engineer at ClickBank and will hopefully still be employed there after graduation.  On an unrelated note: play D&D, go Lakers, go Titans.',
